<h2>1.</h2>
<p>Of the parts of animals, some are simple: to wit, all sorts as
     divide into parts
uniform with themselves, as flesh into flesh, others are composite,
 such as divide into
parts, not uniform with themselves, as, for instance, the hands does
 not divide into
hands nor the face into faces.
<p>And of such as these, some are called not parts
merely, but limbs or members. Such are those parts that, while entire 
in themselves, have within themselves other diverse parts: as for 
instance: the head,foot,hand,the arm
as a whole;for these are all in themselves entire parts and there are 
other diverse parts
belonging to them.</p>
<p>All those parts that do not subdivide into parts uniform with
themselves are composed of parts that do so subdivide,for instance,
hand is composed
of flesh,sinews,and bones. Of animals,some resemble one another in all
 their parts,why
others have parts wherein they differ. Sometimes the parts are 
identical in form or
species,as,for instance,one man's nose or eye resembles another
 man's nose or
eye,flesh flesh,and bone bone,and in like manner with a horse,
and with all other animals
which we reckon to be of one,and the same species,for as the whole
 is to the whole,so
each to each are the parts severally. In other cases,the parts are
 identical,save only for a
difference in the way of excess or defect,as is the case in such
 animals as are of one
and the same genus.By 'genus' i mean,for instance,Bird or Fish,
for each of these is subject to difference in respect of his genus
 and there are many species of fishes and
of birds.</p>
<p>Within the limits of genera,most of the parts as a
     rule exhibit
differences through contrast of the property or accident,such as
 color and shape,to
which they are subject;in that,some are more and some in the less
 degree the subject of
the same property and accident,and also in the way of multitude or 
fewness, magnitude
or parvitude,in short in the way of excess or defect.Thus in some the
 texture of the flesh
is soft,in others firm;some have a long bill, others a short one,some
 have abundance of
feathers, others have only a small quantity,it happens further that
 some have parts that
others have not,for instance;some have spurs and others not,some have 
crests and
others not,but as a general rule,most parts and those that go to make
 up the bulk of the
body are either identical with one another,or differ from one another
 in the way of
contrast and of excess or defect.For 'the more' and 'the less',may be
 represented as
'excess' or 'defect'.</p>
<p>Once again,we may have to do with animals whose parts are neither 
    identical nor yet identical save for differences in the way of 
    excess or defect: but
    they are the same only in the way of analogy,as,for instance,bone
     is only analogous to
    fish-bone,nail to hoof,hand to claw,and scale to feather,for what
     the feather is in a
    bird,the scale is in a fish.</p><p>The parts, then, which animals
         severally possess are
    diverse from,or identical with,one another in the fashion above 
    described.And they are
    so furthermore in the way of local disposition,for many animals 
    have identical organs
    that differ in position,for instance,some have teats in breast, 
    others close to the
    thighs.</p><p>Of the substances that are composed of parts uniform,
        (or homogeneous)
    with themselves,some are soft and moist, others are dry and solid.
     The soft and moist
    are such either absolutely,or so long as they are in the natural
     conditions,as, for
    instance, blood,serum,lard,suet,marrow,sperm,gall,milk in such as
     have it flesh and
    like,and also,in a different way,the superfiuties,as phlegm and 
    the excretion of the belly
    and the bladder. The dry and solid are such as sinew,skin, vein,
    hair, gristle,nail,horn,(a
    term which as applied to the part involves an ambiguity,since the
     whole also by virtue of
    it's form is designated horn)and such parts as present an analogy
     to
    these.</p><p>Animals differ from one another in their mode of 
        subsistence,in their
    actions,in their habits,and in their parts. Concerning these
     differences,we shall treat of
    the same with close reference to each particular genus.</p>
    <p>Differences are manifested in the mode of subsistence,in habits,
        in actions
    performed,fof instance,some animals live in water,and others on
     land. And of those that
    live in water some do so in one way and some in another, that is to
     say,some live and
    feed in the water,take in and emit water,and cannot live if deprived 
    of water,as is the
    case in the great majority of fishes,often get their food and spend
     their days in the water, but do not take in water but air,nor did
      they bring forth in the water. Many of these
    creatures are furnished with feet,as the otter,the beaver, and the
     crocodile,some are
    furnished with wings,as the diver and the grebe,some are destitute 
    of feet,as the water- snake. Some creatures get their living in the
     water and cannot exist outside it, but for all that do not take in
      either air or water,as,for instance,the sea-nettle,and the oystter
      .And of creatures that live in the water, some live in the sea,
      some in river,some in lake,and some in marshes,as the frog and
       the newt.</p>
       <p>Of animals that live on dry land some take in air and emit it,
        which phenomena are termed 'inhalation' and 'exhalation';as,
        for instance, man and all such land animals as are furnished with
         lungs. Others, again, do not inhale air, yet live and find their 
         sustenance on dry land;as, for intance,the wasp, the bee, and all
         other insects. And by 'insects' i mean such creature as have nick
         or notches on their bodies,either on their bellies or on both 
         backs and bellies.</p>
         <p>And of land animals many,as has been said,derive their 
            subsistence from the water,but of creatures that live in and 
        inhale water not a single one derives its subsistence from dry land.</p>
        <p>Some animals at first live in water,and by and by change their 
            shape live out of water,as is the case with river worms,for out
             of these the gadfley develops.</p> 
       <p>Furthermore,some animals are stationary,and some are erratic.
         Stationary animals are found in water,but no such creature is found
        on dry land. In the water,are many creatures that live in close 
        adhesion to an external object,as is the case with several kinds of 
        oyster. And,by the way,the sponge appears to be endowed with a 
        certain sensibility:as a proof of which it is alleged that the 
        difficulty in detaching it from its moorings is increased if the 
        movement to detach it be not covertly applied.</p>
        <p>Other creatures adhere at one time to an object and detach 
            themselves from it at other times,as is the case with a species 
            of the so called sea-nettle,for some of these creatures seek their
             food in the night-time loose and unattached</p>
             <p>Many creatures are unattached, but motionless,as is the cases
                with oysters and the so-called holothuria. Some can swm,as,for instance,
                fishes,molluscs, and crustacean,such as the craw-fish. Butsome of
                these last move by walking,as the crab,for it is the nature of the 
                creature,though it lives in water,to move by walking.</p>
        <p>Of land animals some are furnished with wibgs,such as birds and bees,
            and these are so furnished in different ways one from another;others 
            are furnished with feet. Of the animals that are furnished with feet
            some walk,some creep, and some wriggle. But no creature is able only 
            to move by flying, as the fish is able only to swim,for the animals 
            with leathern wings can walk; the bat has feet and the seal has 
            imperfect feet.</p>
            <p>Some birds have feet of little power,and are therefore called Apodes.
                This little bird is powerful on the wing;and,as a rule,birds that
            resemble it are weak-footed and strong winged,such as the swallow 
            and the drepanis or(?)Alpine swift;for all these birds resemble one another 
            in their habits and in their plumage,and may easily be mistaken one another.
           (The apus is to be seen at all seasons,but the drepanis only after rainy weather
           in summer;for this is the time when it is seen and captured,though,as a general
           rule,it is a rare bird ).</p>
        <p>Again,some animals move by walking on the ground as well as by swimming in 
            water.</p>
        <p>Furthermore,the following differences are manifest in theirs mode of living and
            in their actions. Some are gregarious,some are solitary,whether they be furnished
            with feet or wings or be fitted for a life in the water;and some partake of both
            characters,the solitary and the gregarious. And of the gregarious,some are 
            disposed to combine for social purposes,others to live each for its own self.</p>
        <p>Gregarious creatures are among birds,such as the pigeon,the crane and the swan;
            and by the way,no bird furnished with crooked talons is gregarious,such as 
            the so-called migrants,the tunny,the pelamys,and the bonito.</p>
        <p>Man,by the way,presents a mixture of the characters,the gregarious
            and the solitary.</p>
        <p>Social creatures are such as have some one common object in view;and this property
            is not common to all creatures are man,the bee,the wasp,the ant,and the crane.</p>
        <p>Again,of these social creatures some submit to a ruler,others are subject to no 
            governance:as,for instance,the crane and the several sorts of bee submit to a 
            ruler,whereas ants and numerous other creatures are everyone his own master.</p>
        <p>And again,both of gregarious and of solitary animals,some are attached to a fixed home 
            and others are erratic or nomad.</p>
        <p>Also,some are carnivorous,some gramnivorous,some omnivorous:whilst some feed on a peculiar diet,
            as,for instance the bees and the spiders,for the bee lives on honey and certain other 
            sweets,and the spider lives by catching flies and some creatures live on fish. Again,
            some creatures catch their food,others treasure it up;whereas others do not so.</p>
        <p>Some creatures provide themselves with a dwelling,others go without one:of the former kind 
            are the mole,the mouse,the ant,the bees;of the latter kind are many insects and quadrupeds.
            Further,in respect to locality of dwelling place,some creatures dwell under ground,as the lizard 
            and the snake;others live on the surface of the ground,as the horse and the dog,make themselves
            holes,others do not.</p>
        <p>Some are nocturnal,as the owl and the bat;others live in the daykight.</p>
        <p>Moreover,some creatures are tame and some are wild:some are at all times tame,as man and the mule; 
        others are at all times savage,as the leopard and the wolf; and some creatures can be rapidly tamed,
        as the elephant.</p>
        <p>Again,we may regard animals in another light. For,whenever a race of animals is found domesticated,
            the same is always to be found in a wild conditions;as we find to be the case with horses,kine,swine,
            (men),sheep,goats, and dogs.</p>
        <p>Further,some animals emit sound while others are mute,and some are endowed with voice:of these latter
            some have articulate speech,while others are inarticulate;some are given to continual chirping and
            twitterring some are prone to silence;some are musical,and some unmusical;but all animals without exception
            exercise their power of singing or chattering chiefly in connexion with the intercourse of the sexes.
        </p>
        <p>Again,some creatures live in the field,as the cushat;some on the mountains,as the hoopoe;some frequent the abodes 
            of men,as the pigeon.
        </p>
        <p>Some,again,are peculiar salacious,as the partridge,the barn-door cock and their congeners;others are inclined to 
            chastity,as the whole tribe of crows,for birds of this kind indulge but rarely in sexual intercourse.
        </p>
        <p>Of marine animals,again,some live in the open seas,some near the shore,some on rocks.</p>
        <p>Furthermore,some are combative under offence;others are provident for defence. Of the former kind are such as act 
            as aggressors upon others or retailate when subjected to ill usage,and of the latter kind are such as merely have 
            some means of guarding themselves against attack.
        </p>
        <p>Animals also differ from one another in regard to character in the following respects. Some are goood-tempered,
            sluggish,and little prone to ferocity,as the ox;others are quick-tempered,ferocious and unteachable,as the wild boar;
            some are intelligent and timid,as the stag and the hare;others are mean and treacherous,as the snake;others are noble
            and courageous and high-bred,as the lion;others are thorough-bred and wild and treacherous,as the wolf:for,by the way,
            an animal is highbred if it come from a noble stock,and an animal is thorough-bred if it does not deflect from its racial
            characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>Further,some are crafty and mischievous,as the fox;some are spirited and affectionated and fawning,as the dog;others are 
            easy-tempered and easily domesticated,as the elephant;others are cautious and watchful,as the goose;others are jealous and
            self-concieted,as the peacock. But of all animals man alone is capable of deliberation.
        </p>
        <p>Many animals have memory,and are capable of instruction;but no other creature except man can recall the past at will.</p>
        <p>With regard to the several genera of animals,particulars as to their habits of life and modes of existence will be discussed
            more fully by and by.
        </p>
        <h2>2</h2>
        <p>Common to all animals are the organs whereby they take food and the organs where into they take in;and these are either identical
           with one another,or are diverse in the ways above specified to wit,either identical in form,or varying in respect of excess or defects,
           or resembling one another analogically,or differing in position. 
        </p>
        <p>Furthermore,the great majority of animals have other organs besides these in common,whereby they discharge the residum of their food:
            I say,the great majority,for this statement does not apply to all. And,by the way,the organ whereby food is taken in is called the mouth,
            and the organ whereinto it is taken,the belly;the remainder of the alimentary system has a great variety of names. 
        </p>
        <p>Now the residum of food is twofold in kind,wet,and dry,and such creatures as have organs receptive of dry residum are invariably found with 
            organs receptive need not possess organs receptive of wet residum. In other words,an animal has a bowel or intestine if it have a bladder;
            but an animal may have a bowel and be without a bladder. And,by the way,i may here remark that the organ receptive of wet residum is termed 
            'bladder',and the organ receptive of dry residum 'intestine or bowel'.
        </p>
        <h2>3</h2>
        <p>Of animals otherwise,a great many have,besides the organs above-mentioned,an organ for excretion of the sperm:and of the animals capable of 
            generation one secretes into another,and the other into itself. The latter is termed 'female',and the former 'male';but some animals have 
            neither male nor female. Consequently,the organs connected with this function differ in form,for some animals have a womb and others an organ 
            analogous thereto. The above-mentioned organs,then,are the most indispensable parts of animals;and with some of them all animals without 
            exception,and with others animals for the most part,must needs be provided. 
        </p>
        <p>One sense,and one alone,is common to all animals-the sense of touch. Consequently,there is no special name for the organ in which it has its seat;
            for in some groups of animals the organ is identical,in others it is only analogous.
        </p>
        <h3>4</h3>
        <p>Every animal is supplied with moisture,and,if the animal be deprived of the same by natural causes or artificial means,death ensues:further,every 
            animal has another part in which the moisture is contained. These parts are blood and vein,and in other animals there is something to correspond;
            but in these latter the parts are imperfect,being merely fibre and serum or lymph.</p>
        <p>Touch has its seat in a part uniform and homogeneous,as in the flesh or something of the kind,and generally,with animals supplied with blood,in the
             parts charged with blood. In other animals it has its seat in parts analogous to the parts charged with blood;but in all cases it is seated in parts 
            that in their texture are homogeneous.</p>
        <p>The active faculties,on the contrary,are seated in the parts that are heterogenous:as,for instance,the business of preparing the food is seated in the mouth,
            and the of locomotion in the feet,the wings,or in organs to correspond.</p>
        <p>Again,some animals are supplied with blood,as man,the horse,amd all such animals as are,when full-grown,either destitute of feet,or two-footed,or four-footed;
            other animals are bloodless,such as the bee and the wasp,and,of marine animals,the cuttle-fish,the crawfish,and all such animals as have more than four feet.</p> 
        <h3>5</h3>
        <p>Again,some animals are vivaporous,others oviporous,others vermiporous or 'grub-bearing'.Some are vivaporous,such as man,the horse,the seal,and all other animals
             that are hair-coated,and,of marine animals,the cetaceans,as the dolphin,and the so-called Selachia. (Of these latter animals,some have a tubular air-passage and
              no gills,as the dolphin and the whale:the dolphin with the air-passage going through its bac,the whale with the air passagein its forehead;others have uncovered 
              gills,as the Selachia,the sharks and rays.)</p>
        <p>What we term an egg is a certain completed result of conception out of which the animal that is to be d3velops,and in such a way that in respect to its primitive germ
             develps. A 'grub' on the other hand is a thing out of which in its entirety the animal in its entirety develops,by differentiation and growth of the embryo.</p>
        <p>Of vivaporous animals,some hatch eggs in their own interior,as creatures of the shark kind;others endanger in their interior a live foetus,as man and the horse. 
            When the result of conception is perfected,with some animals a living creature is brought forth,with others an egg is brought to light,with others a grub. Of the eggs,
        the eggs,some have egg-shells and are of two different colors within,such as bird's eggs;others are soft-skinned and of uniform color,as the eggs of some animals of the shark kind.
        Of the grubs,some are from the first capable movement,others are motionless. However,with regard to these phenomena we shall speak precisely hereafter when we come to treat of generation.</p>
        <p>Furthermore,some animals have feet and some are destitute thereof. Of such as have feet some animals have two,as is the case with men and birds,and with men and birds onlu;
            some have four,as the lizard and the dog;some have more,as the centipede and the bee,but allsoever that have feet have an even number of them.</p>
        <p>Of swimming creatures that are destitute of feet,some have winglets or fins,as fishes:and of these some have four fins,two above on the back,two below on the belly,as the gilthead
            and the basse;some have two only;to wit,such as are exceeding long and smooth,as the eel and the conger;some have none at all,as the muraena,but use the sea as the just as snakes 
            use dry ground-and by the way,snakes swim in water in just the same way. Of the shark-kind some have no fins,such as those that are flat and lon-tailed,as the ray and the sting-ray,
            but these fishes swim actually by the undulatory motion of their flat bodies;the fishing frog,however,has fins,and so likewise have all such fishes as have not their flat surfaces
            thinned off to a sharp edge.</p>
            <p>Of these swimmming creatures that appear to have feet,as is the case with the molluscs,these creatures swim by the aid of their feet and their fins as well,and they swim most rapidly
                backwards in the direction of the trunk,as is the case with the cuttle-fish or sepia and the calamary;and,by the way,neither of these latter can walk as the poulpe or octopus can.</p>
        <p>The hard-skinned or crustaceous animals,like the crawfish,swim by the instrumentality of their tail-parts;and they swim most rapidly tail foremost,by the aid of the fins developed upon that 
            member. The next swims by means of its feet and tail;and its tail resembles that of the sheatfish,to compare little with great.</p>
        <p>Of animals that can fly some are furnished with feathered wings,as the eagle and the hawk;some are furnished with feathered wings,as the eagle and the hawk;some are furnished with membranous 
            wings,as the bee and the cockchafer;others are furnished with leathern wings,as the flying fox and the bat. All flying creatures possessed of blood have feathered wings or leathern wings;
            the bloodless creatures have membranous wings,as insects. The creatures that have feathered wings or leathern wings have either two feet or no feet at all:for there are said to be certain 
            flying serpents in Ethiopa that are destitute of feet.</p>
        <p>Creatures that have feathered wings are classed as a genus under the name of 'bird';the other two genera,the leathern-winged and membrane-winged,are as yet without a generic title.</p>
        <p>Of creatures that can fly and are bloodless some are coleopterous or sheath-winged,for they have their wings in a sheath or shard,like the cockchafer and the dung-beetle;others are sheathless,
            and of these latter some are diplterous and some tetrapterous:tetrapterous,such as are comparatively large or have their stings in the tail,dipterous,such as are comparatively small or have their 
            stings in front. The coleoptera are,without exception,devoid of stings;the diptera have the sting in front,as the fly,the horsefly,the gadfly,and the gnat.</p> 
        <p>Bloodless animals as a general rule are inferior in point of size to blooded animals;though,by the way,there are found in the sea some few bloodless creatures of abnormal size,as in case of certain 
            molluscs. And of these bloodless genera,those are the largest that dwell in milder climates,and those that inhabit the sea are larger than those living on dry land or in flesh water.</p>
        <p>All creatures that are capable of motion move with four or more points of motion;the blooded animals with four only;as,for instance,man with two hands and two feet,birds with two wings and two feet,
            quadrupeds and fishes severally with four feet and four fins. Creatures that have two winglets or fins,or that have none at all like serpents,move all the same with not less than four points of motion;
            for there are four points in their bodies as they move,or two bends together with their fins. Bloodless and many footed animals,whether furnished with wings or feet,move with more than four points
            of motion;as,for instance,the dayfly moves with four feet and four wings;and i may observe in  passing,this creature is exceptional not only in regard to the duration of its existence,whence it 
            receives its name,but also because though a quadruped it has wings also.</p>  
        <p>All animals move alike,four-footed and many-footed;in other words,they all move cross-corner-wise. And animals in general have two feet in advance;the crab alone has four.</p>
        <h3>6</h3>
        <p>Very extensive genera of animals,into which other subdivisions fall,are the following:one,of birds;one,of fishes;and another;of cetaceans. Now all these creatures are blooded.</p>
        <p>There is another genus of the hard-shell kind,which is called oyster;another of the soft-shell kind,not as yet designated by a single term,such as the spiny crawfish and the various kinds of crabs and lobsters;
            and another of molluscs,as the two kinds of calamary and the cuttle-fish;that of insect is different. All these latter creatures are bloodless,and such of them as have feet have a goodly number of them;and of 
            the insects some have wings as well as feet.</p>
        <p>Of the other animals the genera are not expensive. For in them one species does not comprehend many species;but in one case,as man,the species is simple,admitting of no differentiation,but the forms lack
            lack particular designations.</p>
        <p>So,for instance,creatures that are qudapedal and unprovided with wings are blooded without exception,but some of them are vivaporous,and some oviparous. Such as are viviparous are hair-coated,and such as 
            oviparous are covered with a kind of tessellated hard substance;and the tessellated bits of this substance are,as it were,similar in regard to position to a scale.</p>
        <p>An animal that is blooded and capable of movement on dry land,but is naturally unprovided with feet,belongs to the serpent genus;and animals of the genus are coated with the tessellated horny substance. 
            Serpents in general are oviparous;the adder,an exceptional case,is vivaporous:for not all viviporous animals are hair-coated;and some fishes also are viviparous.</p>
        <p>All animals,however,that are hair-coated are viviparous. For,by the way,one must regard as a kind of hair such prickly hairs hedgehogs and porcupines carry;for these spines perform the office of hair,and
             not on feet as is the case with similar parts of sea-urchins.</p>
        <p>In the genus that combines all viviparous quadrupeds are many species,but under no common apellation. They are only named as it were one by one,as we say man,lion,stag,horse,dog, and so on;though,by the way,
            there is a sort of genus that embraces all creatures that have bushy manes and bushy tails,such as the horse,the ass,the mule,the jennet,and the animals that are called Hemioni in Syria;from their externally
            resembling mules,though they are not strictly of the same species. And that they are not so is proved by the fact that they mate with and breed with another. For all these reasons,we must take animals species
             by species,and discuss their peculiarities severally.</p> 
        <p>These preceding statements,then,have been put forward thus in a general way,as a kind of foretaste of the number of subjects and of the properties that we have to consider in order that we may first get a clear
             notion of distintive character and common properties. By and by we shall discuss these matters with greater minuteness.</p>
        <p>After this we shall pass on to the discussion of causes. For to do this when the investigation of the details is complete is the proper and natural method,and that whereby the subjects and the premisses of our 
            argument will afterwards be rendered plain.</p>
        <p>In the first place we must look to the constituent parts of the animals. For it is in a way relative to these parts,first and foremost,that animals in their entirety differ from one another:either in the fact that
             some have this or that,while they have not that or this;or by perculiarities of position or of arrangement;or by differences that have been previously mentioned,depending upon diversity of form,or excess or defect 
            in this or that particular,on analogy or on contrasts of the accidental qualities.</p>
        <p>To begin with,we must take into considerations the parts of man. For,just as each nation is won't to reckon by that monetery standard with which it is most familiar,so must we do in other matters. And,of course man is
             the animal with which we are all of us the most familiar.</p>
        <p>Now the pairs are obvious enough to physics perception. However,with the view of observing due order and sequence and of combining rational notions with physical perception,we shall proceed to enumerate the parts;firstly,
            the organic,and afterwards the simple or non-composite.</p>
        <h3>7</h3>
        <p>The chief parts into which the body as a whole is subdivided,are the head,the neck,the trunk (extending from the neck to the privy parts),which is called the thorax,two arms and two legs.</p>
        <p>Of the parts of which the head is composed the hair-covered portion is called the 'skull'. The front portion of it is termed 'bregma'or 'sinciput',developed after birth-for it is the last of all the bones in the body to 
            acquire solidity,the hinder part is termed 'occiput',and the part intervening between the siniciput,the occiput is the 'crown'. The brain lies underneath the siniciput;the occiput is hollow. The skull consists entirely of 
        thin bone,rounded in shape,and contained within a wrapper of fleshless skin.</p>
        <p>The skull has sutures:one,of circular form,in the case of women;in the case of men,as a general rule,three meeting at a point. Instances,have been known of a man's skull devoid of suture altogether. In the skull the middle line,
            where the hair parts is called the crown or vertex. In some cases the parting is double,that is to say,some men are double crowned,not in regard to the borny skull,but in consequence of the double fall or set of the hair.</p> 
        <h3>8</h3>
        <p>The part that lies under the skull is called the 'face':but in the case of man only,for the term is not applied to a fish or to an ox. In the face the part below the sinciput and between the eyes is termed the forehead. When men 
            have large foreheads,they are slow to move;when they have small ones,they are fickle;when they have broad ones,they are apt to be distraught;when they have foreheads rounded or bulging out,they are quick-tempered.</p>
            <h3>9</h3>
            <p>Underneath the forehead are two eye brows. Straight eyebrows are a sign of softness of disposition;such as curve in towards the nose,of harshness;such as curve out towards the temples,of humor and dissimulation,such as are drawn in
                 towards another,of jealousy.</p>
            <p>Under the eyebrows come the eyes. These are naturally two in number,each of them has an upper and a lower eyelid,and the hairs on the edges of these are termed 'eyelashes'. The central part of the eye includes the moist part whereby 
                vision is effected, termed the 'pupil',and the part surrounding the it called the 'black';the part outside this is the 'white'. A part common to the upper and lower eyelid is a pair of nicks and corners,one in the direction of the nose,
                 and the other in the direction of the temples. When these are long they are a sign of bad deposition;if the side toward the nostril be fleshy and comb-like, they are a sign of dishonesty.</p>
            <p>All animals,as a general rule,are provided with eyes,excepting the ostracoderms and other imperfect creatures;at all events,all viviparous animals have eyes,with the exception of the mole. And yet one might assert that, though the mole has
                 not eyes in the full sense,yet it has eyes in a kind of a way. For in point of absolute fact it cannot see,and has no eyes visible externally;but when the outer skin is removed,it is found to have the place where eyes are usually situated,
                 and the black parts of the eyes rightly situated,and all the place that is on the outside to the eyes; showing that the parts are stunted development,and the skin allowed to grow over.</p>
            <h3>10</h3>
            <p>Of the eye the white is pretty much the same in all creatures;but what is called the black differs in various animals,some have the rim black,some distinctly blue,some greyish blue,some greenish,and this last color is the sign of an excellent 
                disposition,and is particularly well adapted for sharpness of vision.Man is the only,or nearly the only, creature,that has eyes of diverse colors. Animals,as a rule, have eyes of one color only. Some horses have blue eyes.</p>
            <p>Of eyes,some are large,some small,some medium-sized;of these,the medium-sized are the best. Moreover, eyes sometimes protude, sometimes recede, sometimes are neither protuding nor receding. Of these,the receding eye is in all animals the most 
                acute,but the last kind is the sign of the best deposition. Again,eyes are sometimes inclined to wink under observation, sometimes to remain open and staring,and sometimes disposed neither to wink nor stare. The last kind are the sign of the 
                best nature,and of the others,the latter kind indicates impudence,and the formal indecision.</p>
            <h3>11</h3>
            <p>Furthermore, there is a portion of the head,whereby an animal hears,a part incapable of breathing;for Alcmaeon is mistaken when he says that goat inspire through their ears. Of the ear,one part is unnamed,the other part is called the 'lobe';and
                 it is entirely composed of gristle and flesh. The ear is constructed internally like the trumpet-shell,and the innermost bone is like the ear itself,and into it at the end,the sound makes it's way,as into the bottle of a jar. This receptacle 
                 does not communicate by any passage with the brain,but does so with the palate,and a vein extends from the brain towards it. The eyes also are connected with the brain,and each of them lies at the end of a little vein. Of animals possessed of
                  ears;man is the only one that cannot move this organ. Of animals possessed of hearing,some have ears, whilst others have none, but merely have the passages for ears visible,as, for example, feathered animals or animals coated with horny 
                  tessellates.</p>
            <p>Viviparous animals,with the exception of the seal,the dolphin,and those others which after a similar fashion to these are cetaceans,are all provided with ears;for,by the way,the shark-kind are also viviparous. Now the seal mouth-an aperture through
                 which,when men,in drinking, inhale any of the liquid, this liquid finds it's way out through the nostrils. In betwixt the two opening comes the so-called epiglottis,an organ capable of being drawn over and covering the office of the windpipe 
                 communicating with the mouth;the end of the tongue is attached to the epiglottis. In the other direction,the windpipe extends to the interval between the lungs and hereupon bifurcates into each of the two divisions of the lungs; for the lung in all
                  animals possessed of the organ has a tendency to be double. In viviparous animals, however,the duplication is not so plainly discernible as in other species and the duplication is least discernible in man. And in man the organ is not split into many
                   parts,as is the case with some vivipra, neither is it smooth, but it's is uneven.</p>
            <p>In the case of the ovipra,such as birds and oviparous quadrupeds,the two parts of the organ are separated to a distance from one another,so that the creature will appear to be furnished with a pair of lungs;and from the windpipe, itself single, 
                there branch off two separate parts extending to each of the two divisions of the lungs. It is attached also to the great vein,and to what is designated the 'aorta'. When the windpipe is charged with air,the air passes on to the hollow parts of the lung. 
                These parts have divisions, composed of gristle,which meet at an acute angle;from the divisions run passages through the entire lung,giving of smaller and smaller ramifications. The heart also is attached to the by connexion of fat, gristle and sinew;and 
                at the point of junction there is a hollow. When the windpipe is charged with air,the entrance of the air into the heart, though imperceptible in some animals,is perceptible enough in the larger ones. Such are the properties of the windpipe,and it takes 
                in and throws out air only, and takes in nothing else either dry or liquid,or else it causes you pain until you shall have coughed up whatever may have gone down.</p>
            <p>The oesophagus communicates at the top with the mouth close to the windpipe,and is attached to the backbone,and the windpipe by membranous ligaments,and at last find it's way through the midriff into the belly,it is composed of flesh-like substance and is 
                elastic both lengthways and breadthways.</p>
        <p>The stomach of man resembles that of a dog;for it is not much bigger than the bowel,but is somewhat like a bowel of more than usual width;then comes the bowel,single,convulated,moderately wide. The lower part of the gut is like that of a pig;for it is broad,and 
            the part from it to the buttocks is thick and short. The caul,or great omentum,is attached to the middle of the stomach,and consists of a fatty membrane,as is the case with all other animals whose stomach are single and which have teeth in both jaws.</p>
        <p>The mesentery is over the bowels;this also is membranous and broad,and turns to fat. It is attached to the great vein and the aorta,and there run through it a number of veins closely packed together,extending towards the region of the bowels,begining above and 
            ending below.</p>
        <p>So much for the properties of oesophagus,the windpipe,and the stomach.</p>
        <h3>12</h3>
        <p>The heart has three cavities,and is situated above the lung at the division of the windpipe,and is provided with a fatty and thick membrane where it fastens on to the great vein and the aorta. It lies with it's tapering portion upon the aorta,and this portion is
             similarly situated in relation to the chest in all animals that have a chest. In all animals alike,in those that have a chest and in those that have none,the apex of the heart points forwards,although this fact might possibly escape notice by a change of position 
             under dissection. The rounded end of the heart is at the top. The apex is to a great extent fleshy and close in texture,and in the cavity of the heart are sinews. As a rule the heart is situated in the middle of the chest in animals that have a chest,and in man 
             it is situated a little to the left-hand side,leaning a little way from the division of the breasts towards the left breast in the upper part of the chest.</p>
        <p>The heart is not large,and it's general shape it is not elongated;in fact,it is somewhat round in form:only,be it remembered,it is sharp-pointed at the bottom. It has three cavities,as has been said:the right-hand one the largest has the passages visible whereby it hears;
            but the dolphin can hear,but has no ears,nor yet any passages visible. But man alone is unable to move his ears,and all other animals can move them. And the ears lie,with man,in the same horizontal plane with the eyes,and not in a plane above them as is the case with 
            some quadrupeds. Of ears,some are fine,some are coarse,and some are of medium texture;the last kind are best for hearing,but they serve in no way to indicate character. Some ears are large,some small,some medium-sized;again,some stand out far,some lie in close and tight,
            and some take up a medium position;of these such as are of medium size and of medium position are indications of the best disposition,while the large and outstanding ones indicate a tendency to irrevelant talk or chattering. The part intercepted between the eye,the ear,
            and the crown is termed the 'temple'. Again,there is a part of the countenance that serves as a passage for the breath,the 'nose'. For a man inhales and exhales by this organ,and sneezing is effected by it's means:which last is an outward rush of collected breath,and is the 
            only mode of breath used as an omen and regarded as supernatural. Both inhalation and exhalation go right on from the nose towards the chest;and with the nostrils alone and seperately it is impossible to inhale or exhale,owing to the fact that the inspiration and respiration
            take place from the chest along the windpipe,and not by any portion connected with the head;and indeed it is possible for a creature to live without using this process of nasal respiration. </p>
        <p>Again,smelling takes place by means of the nose,-smelling,or the sensible discrimination of odour. And the nostril admits of easy motion,and is not,like the ear,intrinsically immovable. A part of it,composed of gristle,constitutes,a septum or partition,and part is an open passage;
            for the nostril consists of two seperate channels. The nostril(or nose) of the elephant is long and strong,and the animal uses it like a hand;for by means of this organ it draws objects towards it,and takes hold of them,and introduces it's food into it's mouth,whether liquid 
            or dry food,and it is the only living creature that does so.</p>
        <p>Furthermore,there are two jaws;the front part of them constitutes the chin,and the hinder part the cheek. All animals move the lower jaw,with the exception of the river crocodile;this creature moves the upper jaw only.</p>
        <p>Next after the nose come two lips,composed of flesh,and facile of motion. The mouth lies inside the jaws and lips. Parts of the mouth are the roof or palate and the pharynx.</p>
        <p>The part that is sensible of taste is the tongue. The sensation has it's seat at the tip of the tongue;if the object to be tasted be placed on the flat surface of the organ,the taste is less sensibly experienced. The tongue is sensitive in all other ways wherein flesh is so:that is,
            it can appreciate taste. The tongue is sometimes broad,sometimes narrow,and sometimes of medium width;the last kind is the best and the clearest in it's discrimination of taste. Moreover,the tongue is Sometimes loosely hung and sometimes fastened:as in the case of those who mumble 
            and who lisp.</p>
        <p>The tongue consists of flesh,soft and spongy,and the so-called 'epiglottis' is a part of this organ.</p>
        <p>That part of the mouth that splits into two bits is called the 'tonsils';that part that splits into many bits,the 'gums'. Both the tonsils and the gums are composed of flesh. In the gums are teeth,composed of bone.</p>
        <p>Inside the mouth is another part,shaped like a bunch of grapes,a pillar streaked with veins. If this pillar gets relaxed and inflammed it is called 'uvula' or 'bunch of grapes',and it then has a tendency to bring about suffocation.</p>
        <h3>13</h3>
        <p>The neck is the part between the face and the trunk. Of this the front part is the larynx land the back part the <i>ur</i>The front part,composed of gristle,through which respiration and speech is effected,is termed the 'windpipe';the part that is fleshy is the oesophagus,inside just 
        in front of the chine. The part to the back of the neck is the epomis,or 'shoulder point'.</p>
        <p>These then are the parts to be met with before you come to the thorax.</p>
        <p>To the trunk there is a front part and a back part. Next after the neck in the front part is the chest,with a pair of breasts. To each of the breasts is attached a teat or nipple,through which in the case of females the milk percolates;and the breast is a spongy texture. Milk,by the way,
            is found at times in the male;but with male the flesh of the breast is tough,with the female it is soft and porous.</p>
        <h3>14</h3>
        <p>Next after the thorax and in front comes the 'belly',and it's root the 'navel'. Underneath this root the bilateral part is the flank':the undivided part below the navel,the 'abdomen',the extremity of which is the region of the 'pubes';above the navel the 'hypochondrium';the cavity common to 
            the hypochondrium and the flank is the gut-cavity.</p>
        <p>Serving as a brace girdle to the hinder parts is the pelvis,and hence it gets it's name(osphus),for it is symmetrical(isophues)in apperance;of the fundament the part for resting on is termed the 'rump',and the part whereon the thigh pivots is termed the 'socket'(or acetabulum).</p>
        <p>The 'womb' is a part peculiar to the female;and the 'penis' is peculiar to the male. This latter organ is external and situated at the extremity of the trunk;it is composed of two seperate parts:of which the extreme part is fleshy,does not alter in size,and is called the glans;and round about
            it is a skin devoid of any specific title,which integument if it be cut as under never grows together again,any more than does the jaw or the eyelid. And the connexion between the latter and the glans is called the frenum. The remaining part of the penis is composed of gristle;it is easily
            susceptible of enlargement;and it protudes and recedes in the reverse directions to what is observable in the identical organ in cats. Underneath the penis are two 'testicles',and the integument of these is a skin that is termed the 'scrotum'.</p> 
        <p>testicles are not identical with flesh,and are not altogether diverse from it. But by and by we shall treat in an exhaustive way regarding all such parts.</p>
        <h3>15</h3>
        <p>The privy part of the female is in character opposite to that of the male. In other words,the part under the pubes is hollow or receding,and not,like cases;and the arm bends at the elbow. The inner part of the hand is termed the palm',and is fleshly and divided by joints or lines:in the case
             of long-lived people by one or two extending right across,in the case of the short-lived by two,not so extending. The joint between hand and arm is termed the 'wrist'. The outside or back of the hand is sinewy,and has no specific designation.</p>
        <p>There is another duplicate limb,the 'leg'. Of this limb the double-knobbed part is termed the 'thigh-bone',the sliding part of the 'kneecap',the double-part behind it the 'calf',wherein the flesh is sinewy and venous,in some cases drawn upwards towards the hollow behind the knee,as in the case of 
            people with large hips,and in other cases drawn downwards. The lower extremity of the shin is the 'ankle',duplicate in either leg. The part of the limb that contains a multiplicity of bones is the 'foot'. The hinder part of the foot is the 'heel';at the fron of it the divided part is divided parts 
            consists of 'toes',five in number;the fleshy part underneath is the 'ball';the upper part or back of the foot is sinewy and has no particular appellatiom;of the toe,one portion is the 'nail' and another the 'joint',and the nail is in all cases at the extremity;and toes are without exception single 
            jointed. Men that have the inside or sole of the foot clumsy and not arched,that is,that walk resting on the entire under-surface of their feet,are prone to roguery. The joint common to thigh and shin is the 'knee'.</p>  
        <p>These,then,are the parts common to the male and female sex. The relative position of the parts as to up and down,or to front or back,or to right and left,all this as regards externals might safely be left to mere ordinary perception. But for all that,we must treat of them for the same reason as the 
            one previously brought forward;that is to say,we must refer to them in order that a due and regular sequence may be obvious facts due attention may be subsequently given to those parts in men and other animals that are diverse in any way from another.</p>
        <p>In man,above all other animals,the terms 'upper'and 'lower' are used in harmony with their natural positions;for in him,upper and lower have the same meaning as when they are applied to the universe as a whole. In like the male organ,protuding, further, there is an 'urethra' outside the womb;which 
            organ serves as a passage for the sperm of the male,and as an outlet for liquid excretion to both sexes.</p>
        <p>The part common to the neck and chest is 'throat';the armpit is common to side,arm,and shoulder;and the groin is common to thigh and abdomen. The part inside the thigh and buttocks is the 'perineum',and the part outside the thigh and abdomen is the 'hypoglutis'.</p>
        <p>The front parts of the trunk have now been enumerated.</p>
        <p>The part behind the chesy is termed the 'back'.</p>
        <h3>16</h3>
        <p>Parts of the back are a pair of 'shoulderblades',the 'backbone' and underneath the on a level with the belly in the trunk,the 'lions'. Common to the upper and lower part of the trunk is the 'ribs',eight on either side,for as to the so-called seven-ribbed Ligyans we have not received any trustworthy evidence. </p>
        <p>Man,then,has an upper and a lower part,a front and a back part,a right and a left side. Now the right and the left side are pretty well alike in their parts and identical throughout,except that the left side is weaker of the two;but the back parts do not resemble the front ones,neither do the lower ones the 
            upper:only that these upper and lower parts may be said to resemble one another thus far,that,if the face be plumb or meagre,the abdomen is plumb or meagre to correspond;and that the legs correspond abdomen to the arms,and where the upper arm is short the thigh is usually short also,and where the feet are
             small the hands are small corresponding.</p>        
        <p>Of the limbs,one set,forming a pair,is 'arms'. To the arm belong the 'shoulder','upper-arm','elbow','fore-arm',and 'hand'. To the hand belong the 'palm',and the five 'fingers'. The part of the finger that bends is termed 'knuckle',the part that is inflexible is termed the 'phalanx'. The big finger or thumb is 
            single-jointed,the other fingers are double jointed. The bending both of the arm and of the finger takes place from without inwards in all manner the terms,'in front','behind','right'and 'left',are used in accordance with their natural sense. But in regard to other animals,in some cases these distinctions do
             not exist ,and others they do so,but in a vague way. For instance,the head with all animals is up and above in respect to their bodies;but man alone,as has been said,has,in maturity,this part uppermost in respect to the material universe.</p>
        <p>Next after the head comes the neck,and then the chest and the back:the one in front and the other behind. Next after these come the belly,the lions,the sexual parts,and the haunches;then the thigh and shin,and,lastly,the feet.</p>
        <p>The legs bend frontwards,in the direction of actual progression,and frontwards also lies that part of the foot which is the most effective of motion,and the flexure of that part;but the heel lies at the back,and the anklebones lie laterally,earwise. The arms are situated to the right and left,and bend inwards:
            so that the convexities formed by bent arms and legs are practically face to face with one another in the case of man. </p>
        <p>As for the senses and for the organs of sensation,the eyes,the notrils,and the tongue,all alike are situated frontwards;the sense of hearing,and the organ of hearing,the ear,is situated sideways,on the same horizontal plane with the eyes. The eyes in man are,in proportion to his size,nearer to one another than 
            in any other animal.</p>
        <p>Of the senses man has the sense of touch more refined than any animal,and so also,but in less degree,the sense of taste;in the development of the other senses he is surpassed by a great number of animals.</p>
        <h3>16</h3>
        <p>The parts,then,that are externally visible are arranged in the way above stated,and as a rule have their special designation,and from use and won't are known familiary to all;but this is not the case with the inner parts. For the fact is that the inner parts of man are to a very great extent unknown,and the consequence
            is that we must have resource to an examination of the inner part of other animals whose nature in any way resembles that of man.</p>
        <p>In the first place then,the brain lies in the front part of the head. And this holds alike with all animals possessed of a brain;and all blooded animals are possessed thereof,and,by the way,molluscs as well. But,taking size for size of animal,the largest brain,and the moistest,is that of the man. Two membranes enclose it:
            the stronger one near the bone of the skull;the inner one,round the brain itself,is finer. The brain in all cases is bilateral. Behind this right at the back,comes what is termed the 'cerebellum',differing in form from the brain as we may both feel and see. </p>
        <p>The back of the head is with all animals empty and hollow,whatever be it's size in the different aniimals. For some creatures have big heads while the face below is small in proportion,as is the case,without exception,among animals of the mane-and tall species.</p>
        <p>The brain in all animals is bloodless,devoid of veins,and naturally cold to the touch;in the great majority of animals it has a small hollow in it's center. The brain-caul around it is reticulated with veins;and this brain-caul is that skin-like membrane which closely surrounds the brain. Above the brain is the thinnest 
            and weakest bone of the head,which is termed or 'sinciput'.</p>
        <p>From the eye there go three ducts to the brain:the largest and the medium-sized to the cerebellum,the least to the brain itself;and the least is the one situated nearest to the nostril. The two largest ones,then,run side by side and do not meet;the medium-sized ones meet-and this is particularly visible in fishes;for they 
            lie nearer than the larger ones to the brain;the smallest pair are the most widely seperate from one another,and do not meet.</p>
        <p>Inside the neck is what they termed the oesophagus(whose other name is derived oesophagus from it's lenght and narrowness),and the windpipe. The windpipe is situated in front of the oesophagus in all animals that have a windpipe,and all animals have one that are furnished with lungs. The windpipe is made up of gristle,is sparingly
            supplied with blood,and is streaked all round with numerous minute veins;it is situated,in it's upper part,near the mouth,below the aperture formed by the nostrils into the of three,the left-hand one the least,and the middle one intermidiate in size. All these cavities,even the two small ones,are connected by passages with the lung,
            and this fact is rendered quite plain in one of the cavities. And below,at the point of attachment,in the largest cavity there is a connexion with the great vein(near which the mesentery lies);and in the middle one there is a connexion with the aorta.</p>
        <p>Canals lead from the heart into the lung,and branch off just as the windpipe does,running all over the lung parallel with the passages from the windpipe. The canals from the heart are uppermost;and there is no common wall receive the breadth and pass it on to the heart;and one of the passages conveys it to the right cavity,
            and the other to the left.</p>
        <p>With regard to the great vein and the aorta we shall,by and by,treat of them together in a discussion devoted to them and to them alone. In all animals that are furnished with a lung,and that are both internally and externally viviparous,the lung is of all organs the most richly supplied with blood;for the lung is throughout spongy
            in texture,and along by every single pore in it go branches from the great vein. Those who imagine it to be empty are altogether mistaken;and they are led into their error by their observation of lungs removed from animals under dissection,out of which organs the blood had all escaped immediately after death.</p>
        <p>Of the other internal organ the heart alone contains blood. And the lung has blood not in itself but in it's veins,but the heart has blood in itself;for in each of it's three cavities it has blood,but the thinnest blood is what it has in it's central cavity.</p>
        <p>Under the lung comes the thoracic diaphragm or midriff,attached to the ribs,the hypochondrium and the backbone,with a thin membrane in the middle of it. It has veins running through it;and the diaphragm in the case of man is thicker in proportion to the size of his frame than in other animals. </p>
        <p>Under the diaphragm on the right-hand side lies the 'liver',and on the left-hand side the 'spleen',alike in all animals that are provided with these organs in an ordinary and not preternaturally way;for,be it observed,in some quadrupeds these organs have been found in a transposed position. These organs are connected by the stomach by the caul.</p>
        <p>To outward view,the spleen of man is narrow and long, resembling the self-same organ in the pig. The liver in the great majority of animals is not provided with a 'gall bladder';but the latter is present in some. The liver of a man is round shaped,and resembles the same organ in the ox. And,by the way,the absence above refered to a gall bladder is at times met within the practice of augury. For instance,in a certain district of the chalcidic settlement in Euboea the sheep are devoid of the gall bladder;and in Naxos, nearly all the quadrupeds have one so large that foreigners when they offer sacrifice with such victims,are bewildered with fright, under the impression that the phenomenon is not due to natural causes, but bodes some mischief to the individual offers of the sacrifice.</p>
        <p>Again,the liver is attached to the great vein, but it has no connection with the aorta;for the vein that goes off from the great vein goes right through the liver,at a point where are the so-called 'portals' of the  liver. The spleen also is connected only with the great vein,for a vein extends to the speen off from it.</p>
        <p>After this organs come the 'kidney',and these are placed close to the backbone,and resemble in character the same organ in kine. In all animals that are provided with this organ,the right kidney is situated higher up than the older. It has also less fatty substance than the left-hand one and is less moist. And this phenomen also is observable in all the other animals alike.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, passages or ducts lead into the kidneys both from the great vein and from the aorta,not only into the cavity. For, by the way,there is a cavity in the middle of the kidney, bigger in some creatures and less in others;but there is none in the case of the seal. This latter animals has kidneys resembling in shape the identical in kine,but in it's case the organs are more solid than in any other known creature. The ducts that lead into the kidneys lose themselves in substance of the kidneys themselves;and the proof that they extend no farther rest on the fact that they contain no blood,nor is any clot found therein. The kidneys, however,have,as has been said,a small cavity. From this cavity in the kidney there lead twoconsiderable ducts or ureters into the bladder;and others spring from the aorta,stromg and continous.</p>
            <p> And to the middle of each of the two kidneys is attached to a hollow sinewy vein,stretching right along the spine through the narrows;by and by these veins are lost in either loin,and again become visible extending to the flank.</p>
            <p> And these off-branchings of the veins terminate in the bladder. For the bladder lies at the extremity,and is held in position by the ducts stretching from the kidneys,along the stalk that extends to the urethra;and pretty well all round it is fastened by fine sinewy membranes,that resemble to some extent the thoracic diaphragm. The bladder in man is,proportionately to his size,tolerably large.</p>
            <p>To the stalk of the bladder the private part is attached,the external orifices coalescing;but a little lower down,one of the openings communicate with the testicles,and the other with the bladder. The penis is gristy and sinewy in it's texture. With it are connected with the testicles in male animas,and the properties of these organs we shall discuss in our general account of the said organ.</p>
            <p>All these organs are similar in the female;for there is no difference in regard to internal organs, except in respect to womb,and with reference to the appearance of this organ,i must refer the reader to diagrams in my 'Anatomy'. The womb, however,is situated over the bowel,and the bladder lies over the womb. But we must treat by and by our pages of the womb of all female animals viewed generally. For the wombs of all female animals are not identical, neither do their local depositions coincide.</p>
            <p>These are the organs, internal and external,of man,and such is there nature,and such their local deposition.</p>
            <h4>BOOK 2</h4>
            <h5>1</h5>
            <p>With regards to animals in general,some parts or organs are common to all,as has been said,and some are common only to particular genera,the parts, moreover,are identical with or different from one another on the lines already repeatedly laid down. For as a general rule,all animals that are generically distinct have the majority of their parts or organs different in form or species;and some of them they have only analogically similar or diverse in kind or genus,while they have others that are alike in kind but specific diverse;and many parts or organs exist in some animals,but not in others.</p>
            <p>For instance, viviparous quadrupeds have all a head and a neck,and all the parts or organs of the head but they differ each from other in the shapes of the parts. The lion has it's neck composed of one single bone not vertebrae; but when dissected,the animal is found in all internal characters to resemble the dog.</p>
            <p>The quadrupedal vivipara instead of arms have forelegs. This is true of all quadrupeds,but such of them as have toes have, practically speaking,organs analogue to hands,at all events,they use these fore-limbs,for many purposes as hands. And they have these limbs on the left-hand side less distinct from those on the right than man.</p>
            <p>The fore-limbs then serve more or less the purpose of hands in quadrupeds,with the exception of the elephant. This latter animal has it's toes somewhat indistinctly defined and it's front legs are much bigger than it's hinder ones;it is five-toed,and has short ankles to it's hind feet. But it has a nose such in properties and such in size as to allow of it's using the same for a hand. For it eats and drinks,by lifting up it's food with the aid of this organ into it's mouth,and with the same organ it lifts up to the driver on it's back; with this organ it can pluck up trees by the roots and when walking through water it spouts the water up by means of it;and this organ is capable of being crooked or coiled at the tip but not of flexing like a joint,for it is composed of gristle.</p>
            <p>Of all animals man alone can learn to make equal use of both hands.</p>
            <p>All animals have a part analogous to the chest in man, but not similar to his;for the chest in man is broad, but that of all other animals is narrow. Moreover,no other animal but man has breast in front;the elephant, certainly,has two breasts, not however in the chest, but near it.</p>
            <p>Moreover,also, animals have the flexions of their fore and hind limbs in directions opposite to one another,and in directions the reverse of those observed in the arms and legs of man; with the exception of the elephant. In other words,with the viviparous quadrupeds the front legs bend fowards and the hind ones backwards,and the concavities of the two pairs of limb thus face one another.</p>
            <p>The elephant does not sleep standing,as some were won't to assert,but it bends it's leg and settles down;only that in consequence of it's weight it cannot bend it's leg on both sides simultaneously, but falls into a recumbent position on one side or the other, and in this position it goes to sleep. And it bend it's hind legs just as like a man bends his legs.</p>
            <p>In the case of the ovipra,as the crocodile and the lizard and the like both pairs of legs,fore and hind,bend forwards,with a slight swerve on one side.The flexion is similar in the case of the multipeds;only that the legs in between the extreme ends always move in a manner intermediate between that of those in front and those behind,and accordingly bend sideways rather than backwards or forwards. But man bends his arms and his legs towards the same point, and therefore in opposite  ways;that is to say,he bends his arms backwards,with just a slight inclination inwards and his legs frontwards.No animal bends it's fore-limbs and hind-limbs backwards;but in the case of all animals the flexion of the shoulders is in the opposite direction to that of the elbows or the joints of the forelegs, and the flexure in the hips to that of the knees of the hind-legs;so that since man differs from other animals in flexion,those animals that possess such part as these move them contrariwise to man.</p>
